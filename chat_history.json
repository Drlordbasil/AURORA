These models have shown exceptional problem-solving capabilities, which could be applied to solving challenges like the \"arc challengers\".\n\nAnother company that could be considered is OpenAI, which has been actively researching and developing general-purpose AI models that can solve complex problems. Their models, such as GPT-3 and DALL-E, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in areas like language processing and image generation.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the concept of \"arc challengers\" is relatively vague, and without more specific information about what these challenges entail, it's difficult to determine which company is closest to solving them with 100% accuracy.\n\nIf you could provide more context or information about the \"arc challengers\", I'd be happy to try and provide a more specific answer.", "user": false}, {"text": "You: What about whos closer to solving the arc challengers to 100% accuracy?", "user": false}, {"text": "AURORA: Based on the aggregated responses from all lobes and thinking processes, I'll provide a coherent and direct answer to your question.\n\nCurrently, the company closest to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is Google DeepMind.
